# Single cell workflows
This repository is featuring all single cell workflows of the [bioinformatics core facility](https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/bi/index.html) at the [Insititute of Computational biology](https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de/icb/) at the [Helmholtz Zentrum MÃ¼nchen](https://www.helmholtz-muenchen.de).

Our workflows are based on [dolphin-next](https://github.com/UMMS-Biocore/dolphin-docker) and [nextflow](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow) or [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
